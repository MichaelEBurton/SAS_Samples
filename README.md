# Repository Intro.

This repository hosts the project files (SAS programs, and requirements files) from my Intermediate SAS programming class taken while attending North Carolina State University, taught by [Dr. Jonathan Duggins](https://jonathanduggins.com/). In addition to this course I also had the pleasure of taking its preceding course, Introduction to statistical computing and data management.

## File Descriptions
The files in this repository are either the project file (MP*.sas) containing the completed SAS code and the corresponding program requirements (MP*.pdf).

**\*** Some of these projects may still be in for the Intermediate SAS programming course, so they have been moved to a private repository. If you are a prospective employer and would like to see any of the code, please feel free to email me and I will get back to you.

+ MP1GroupG.sas
  - This project focused on simulating data for various combinations of probability distributions, replications, and sample size. Upon generating the data we calculated the summary statistic specified by the user and then plotted the data using Proc sgplot and by group processing.
+ MP2GroupB.sas
  - This project emphasized using the SQL procedure by reading in  a raw text file, reshaping it with proc sql, and then creating a report using proc report. Additionally we created a custom graphic using the Template procedure, and ensured that our data was similar to our professor's using proc compare.
+ MP3GroupF.sas
  - For this project we created a macro program that will produce an animation demonstrating what happens to the sampling distribution of a sample statistic as the sample size increases. For more details on what parameters this macro took in please click on the corresponding file.
+ MP4GroupZ.sas
  - This project focused on learning more about webscraping in SAS by using the HTTP procedure, and quantile regression using proc quantreg. Specifically we created a macro to scrape data on Pokemon from the website https://www.serebii.net/pokedex/ and investigated whether there was a relationship between a pokemon's hitpoints and attacks stats, and did it change by quantile?

## Coursework

### Introduction to Statistical Computing and Data Management
Procedures and Facilities covered
  + Data Step
  + Proc Freq
  + Proc Report
  + Proc Sgplot
  + Proc Format
  + Proc Contents

Description:
  >Detailed discussion of the program data vector and data handling techniques that are required to apply statistical methods. Topics are based on the current content of the Base SAS Certification Exam and typically include: importing, validating, and exporting of data files; manipulating, subsetting, and grouping data; merging and appending data sets; basic detail and summary reporting; and code debugging. Additional topics with practical applications, such as graphics and advanced reporting, may also be introduced. Statistical methods for analyzing data are not covered in this course. Regular access to a computer for homework and class exercises is required. Previous exposure to SAS is expected.

### Intermediate SAS Programming with Applications
Procedures and Facilities covered
  + SAS/Macros
  + SAS/SQL
  + Proc FCMP
  + Proc Template
  + Proc Datasets
  + Proc Compare

Description:
  > This course covers a wide range of SAS skills that build on the topics introduced in ST 445: Introduction to Statistical Computing and Data Management. In particular, many topics related to the Advanced SAS Certifi cation Exam are covered in order to help students prepare for that exam. However, an additional goal of equal importance is to synthesize statistical content such as regression, distributional assumptions for inference, and power from multiple courses through simulation- and graphics-based investigations.

During this course I found the following books particulary useful:
  + [Carpenter's Complete Guide to the SAS Macro Programming Language](https://www.sas.com/store/books/categories/usage-and-reference/carpenter-s-complete-guide-to-the-sas-macro-language-third-edition/prodBK_67815_en.html)
  + [PROC SQL: Beyond the Basics Using SAS](https://www.sas.com/store/books/categories/usage-and-reference/proc-sql-beyond-the-basics-using-sas-third-edition/prodBK_71650_en.html)

## Certifications
Upon completion of my sas programming courses I was able to pass the advanced and base sas programming certification exams.

+ [SAS Certified Advanced Programmer for SAS 9.4](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/047e8f37-ed81-4b2a-8be0-6968d4d42d4c/linked_in_profile)
+ [SAS Certified Base Programmer for SAS 9.4](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/640bf703-0f2d-44c5-a3dd-5a67bbf8e923/linked_in_profile)
